- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I like how 'Inheritance' allows me to utilize code that I've already written. It's a concise and efficient way of writing more methods in less time.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked for me was annotating the ReadMe doc and the rubric so I understood the expectations clearly. There wasn't much for me that didn't work for me; however, I did struggle with the Enumeration a little bit. I watched some videos about how to structure the method, which helped a lot. Advice I would give to someone taking this course in the future is to use all their resources and watch videos.
